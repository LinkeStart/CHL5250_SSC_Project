# CHL 5250 Group Project

This repository contains relevant work regarding the course project required by CHL 5250 Special Topics in Biostatistics. The research question of the  project is adapted from the [SSC 2019 CASE STUDY 2: RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AMONG OSTEOARTHRITIS PATIENTS](https://ssc.ca/en/case-study/case-study-2-risk-cardiovascular-disease-among-osteoarthritis-patients)

## Research Question to consider

- Within Canadian adults (20-64 years of age), is having osteoarthritis associated with the developing heart disease? For the purpose of this case study, assume that, from the literature, we know that the following variables are risk factors for the outcome and confounders in the above relationship: age, sex, ethnicity, education, household income, body mass index (BMI), access to a regular medical doctor, smoking habit, alcohol drinking habit, high-blood pressure, and diabetes. Also, assume that physical activity is suspected to be an intermediate factor between osteoarthritis and heart disease.
- Does the relationship between osteoarthritis and heart disease vary (a) between participants living in the northern parts of Canada versus those living in the southern parts, (b) between men and women, (c) by marital status, or (d) by recency of immigration?    
- Do the results change when missing values (i.e., invalid responses) for the ‘household income’ are imputed? Which assumptions do you have to make to perform such an analysis?
- With the information provided in the PUMF, what would be your interpretation of the analysis results? What are the limitations of this study? What additional information would be helpful in reaching a more meaningful conclusion?
